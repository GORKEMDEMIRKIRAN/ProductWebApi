<p>Node in this project.I have developed a web api background project with javascript language in js environment.I used swagger for the web api interface.</p>
<p>With this project, web and mobile front-end projects enable users to use applications by transferring data, querying data, and verifying data.</p>
<p>In this project, I performed data storage operations with collections of users, products, tokens in the database by using cloud-based storage with mongodb atlas.</p>
<p>The queries that user and admin can make according to their user roles have been determined.  The admin user can perform deletion and update operations, but a user user cannot perform these operations.</p>
